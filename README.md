# flappy-bird
This game of Flappy Bird involved the  manipulation of css borders and pixels using vanilla JavaScript. 

To ensure the game is responsive to different screen sizes, I used 'document.documentElement.clientWidth || window.innerWidth' in the script to alter the border and pixel changes as necessary.

I needed functions to generate and move a top and bottom obstacle (the green pipes).

This most difficult aspect of this game was determining the correct logic to recognise when the bird came into contact with an obstacle or the ground.
