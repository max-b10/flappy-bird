# flappy-bird
This game of Flappy Bird involved the live manipulation of css borders and pixels using vanilla JavaScript. 

I needed functions to generate and move a top and bottom obstacle (the green pipes).  I used setInterval() and DOM Manipulation to achieve this. 

This most difficult aspect of this game was determining the correct logic to recognise when the bird came into contact with an obstacle.
